Title: Integrate DMR sets predicted on a methylation array dataset
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wenjin Zhang
Maintainer: The package maintainer <zhangwenjin@sklmg.edu.cn>
Description: This package is developed for integrating multiple DMR sets predicted from different DMR prediction methods on the same methylation array dataset. First, DMRIntTk_input function calculates the methylation differences of probes and DMRs. Then, DMRIntTk_matrix function constructs the reliablity weight matrix for each method under different thresholds. Next, DMRIntTk_method and DMRIntTk_weight functions calculates the covered DMRs and the weights of pre-split genomic bins. Finally, the DMRIntTk_densitypeak function clusters all genomic bins based on density peak clustering and returns the integrated DMR set according to the user' s preference.
