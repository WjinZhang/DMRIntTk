#' Identify the differentially methylated regions using mCSEA method.
#' This function identifies the differentially methylated regions by using mCSEA method. Users should provide corresponding
#' file and parameters, including the methylation beta matrix file, the phenomenon file with sample information, the caseGroup
#' and the refGroup, the interested regions types, the type of platform, and the threshold for minimum number of CpGs in a DMR.
#' @param beta The methylation beta values matrix of samples from two groups.
#' @param pd The phenomenon data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABIAAAASCAYAAABWzo5XAAAAWElEQVR42mNgGPTAxsZmJsVqQApgmGw1yApwKcQiT7phRBuCzzCSDSHGMKINIeDNmWQlA2IigKJwIssQkHdINgxfmBBtGDEBS3KCxBc7pMQgMYE5c/AXPwAwSX4lV3pTWwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==file with sample information (With Sample group column named Sample_Group).
#' @param caseGroup  The name of case group in the pd file.
#' @param refGroup The name of control group in the pd file.
#' @param regionsTypes The region types you are interested in. mCSEA will identify the DMRs in that specific type of regions.
#' @param platform The type of methylation array, including 450K and EPIC array.
#' @param minCpGs The threshold for minimum number of CpGs in a DMR.
#' @return The DMR set detected by mCSEA.
